# Little Lemon Native

This is a simple project created for the purpose of the React Native Meta Certificate. Using AsyncStorage and SQLite, the application stores some information from the user and allows for searching/filtering through Little Lemon menu items.

Included in this repo is a png screenshot of the three wireframes made for this project using Figma.
